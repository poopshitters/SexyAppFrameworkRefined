**PopCap Games Framework** (officially named **SexyApp Framework**) is the name of a computer game development kit for **C++**, released by PopCap Games. It is designed to let programmers easily and quickly create "PopCap-style" games, and is part of their developer program that encourages game creators to distribute their finished games through PopCap Games. The PopCap Games Framework is licensed under a proprietary free license. The PopCap framework powers casual games such as PopCap's own *Bejeweled* and Sandlot Games' *Cake Mania*. The framework only officially runs on Microsoft Windows, although some games have been ported to Mac using proprietary conversions of the framework.

The name comes from the company's history. PopCap Games was founded by John Vechey, Brian Fiete and Jason Kapalka in 2000. They originally incorporated as 'Sexy Action Cool', a phrase taken from a poster of Desperado. Their first title was a strip poker game called 'Foxy Poker' and was supposed to serve as a revenue stream for their future titles.
