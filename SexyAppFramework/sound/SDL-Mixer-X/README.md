# SDL Mixer X

An audio mixer library, a fork of [SDL_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer) library

# Description
SDL_Mixer is a sample multi-channel audio mixer library.
It supports any number of simultaneously playing channels of 16 bit stereo audio,
plus a single channel of music, mixed by the popular FLAC, OPUS, XMP, ModPlug,
Timidity MIDI, FluidSynth, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, and MPG123 MP3 libraries.

SDL Mixer X - is an extended fork made by Vitaly Novichkov "Wohlstand" in
13 January 2015. SDL_mixer is a quick and stable high-quality audio library,
however, it has own bunch of defects such as incorrect playback of some WAV files,
inability to choose MIDI backend in runtime, inability to customize Timidity patches path,
No support for cross-fade and parallel streams playing (has only one musical stream.
Using of very long Chunks is ineffective), etc. The goal of this fork is to resolve those
issues, providing more extended functionality than was originally,
and providing support for more audio formats.

Fork with added libopenmpt support made by Headshotnoby (headshot2017)
